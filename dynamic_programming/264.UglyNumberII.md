#[LeetCode 264] Ugly Number II  
Write a program to find the **n**-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. 
For example, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12` is the sequence of the first `10` ugly numbers.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

**Hint:**

 * 1. The naive approach is to call `isUgly` for every number until you reach the **n**th one. 
 Most numbers are not ugly. Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.Show More Hint
