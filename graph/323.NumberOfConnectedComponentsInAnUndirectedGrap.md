#[LeetCode 323] Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of **undirected edges** (each edge is a pair of nodes), 
write a function to find **the number of connected components** in an undirected graph.

**Example 1:**

     0          3

     |          |

     1 --- 2    4

Given `n = 5` and `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`, return `2`.

**Example 2:**

     0           4

     |           |

     1 --- 2 --- 3

Given `n = 5` and `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`, return `1`.

**Note:**

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, 
[0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
