#[LeetCode 391] Perfect Rectangle

Given N axis-aligned rectangles where N > 0, determine if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

Each rectangle is represented as a bottom-left point and a top-right point. 
For example, a unit square is represented as `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. (coordinate of **bottom-left** point is (1, 1) and **top-right** point is (2, 2)).


**Example 1:**

    rectangles = [
      [1,1,3,3],
      [3,1,4,2],
      [3,2,4,4],
      [1,3,2,4],
      [2,3,3,4]
    ]

Return **true**. All 5 rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

**Example 2:**
![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/rectangle_separated.gif)

    rectangles = [
      [1,1,2,3],
      [1,3,2,4],
      [3,1,4,2],
      [3,2,4,4]
    ]

Return **false**. Because there is a gap between the two rectangular regions.

**Example 3:**
![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/rectangle_hole.gif)

    rectangles = [
      [1,1,3,3],
      [3,1,4,2],
      [1,3,2,4],
      [3,2,4,4]
    ]

Return **false**. Because there is a gap in the top center.

**Example 4:**
![](https://leetcode.com/static/images/problemset/rectangle_intersect.gif)

    rectangles = [
      [1,1,3,3],
      [3,1,4,2],
      [1,3,2,4],
      [2,2,4,4]
    ]

Return **false**. Because two of the rectangles overlap with each other.
