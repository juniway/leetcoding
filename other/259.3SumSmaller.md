#[LeetCode 259] 3Sum Smaller

Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 
`0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`.

For example, given `nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3]`, and `target = 2`.

Return `2`. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:

    [-2, 0, 1]
    [-2, 0, 3]
