#[LeetCode 243] Shortest Word Distance
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,  
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given word1 = `"coding"`, word2 = `"practice"`, return `3`.
Given word1 = `"makes"`, word2 = `"coding"`, return `1`.

**Note:**  
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

**Challange:**  
Could you solve it in one-pass?

#### Analysis


class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        int n = words.size(), idx1 = -1, idx2 = -1, dist = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (words[i] == word1) idx1 = i;
            else if (words[i] == word2) idx2 = i;
            if (idx1 != -1 && idx2 != -1)
                dist = min(dist, abs(idx1 - idx2));
        }
        return dist;
    }
