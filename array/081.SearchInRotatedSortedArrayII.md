#[LeetCode 81] Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Follow up for "Search in Rotated Sorted Array":  
What if duplicates are allowed?  

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

Write a function to determine if a given target is in the array.

#### Analysis:
This is similar to the problem `Search in Rotated Sorted Array`, the only place that we need to modify is when `nums[mid] == nums[low]`,
we should set low++, in this case, we aren't be able to know whether the part is in ordered, consider :

     1   1   1   3  1
    low     mid

     1   3   1   1  1
    low     mid

As show above, when `nums[mid] == nums[low]`, we can't be sure which part is in order, so we just increase low.

The time complexity will be up to O(n) in worst case (all numbers are equal). 



// 1. Cpp solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int> &nums, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            const int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target)
                return true;

            if (nums[low] == nums[mid]) {
                low++;
            } else if (nums[low] < nums[mid]) {
                if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid])
                    high = mid - 1;
                else
                    low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high])
                    low = mid + 1;
                else
                    high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
