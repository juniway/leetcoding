#[LeetCode 34] Search for a Range

Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

**For example**

    Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,
    return [3, 4].


**Difficulty**  
`Medium`

####Analysis
On sight of O(log n) time, we know it's going to be **Binary Search**.

**Idea**  
Use `binary search` to find the left bound, then use `binary search` to find the right bound.

The trick here is how we use `binary search` to find the bound:  
For a normal `binary search`, we return the index when nums[mid] == target, however, we don't return since we need to keep searching for bound index. So we set the condition to `nums[mid] >= target` for left bound, and `nums[mid] <= target` for right bound, outer loop condition is still low <= high. 

We iterate over [0 ... n - 1] of the array to find the left bound, when `nums[mid] >= target`, we set high = mid - 1, otherwise, low = mid + 1, and keep looping until we found no value equals to target and get out of the loop, now low > high. 
If in the looping procedure we have ever found a value that equals to target and when we break out the loop, low < n, 
then we can make sure, the index low is the left bound. Based on this left bound, we iterate again the [low ... n - 1] of the array to find the right bound.

        const int n = A.size();
        if(n == 0) {
            return {-1, -1};
        }

        vector<int> v;
        int low = 0;
        int high = n - 1;
        
        // Starting from position 0, binary search to find the left bound index of target value
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if(A[mid] >= target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        // if found lower bound
        if(low < n && A[low] == target) {
            v.push_back(low);
        } else { // if not found lower bound, no need to find higher bound
            return {-1, -1};
        }

        high = n - 1;
        // Starting from low position, conitnue to binary search for the right bound index of target value
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if(A[mid] <= target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
