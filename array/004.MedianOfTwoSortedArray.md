#[LeetCode 04] Median of two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. 

**Example 1:**

    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]

    The median is 2.0

**Example 2:**

    nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]

    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5



**Challenge**  
The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).

#### Analysis
This is a classic problem. It has a more general form, that is `"Given two sorted arrays, find the kth element"`.
The median of a sequence of numbers is that after the numbers are sorted, it is greater than half of the numbers, and smaller the other half. 

**1. O(m + n)**  

It's natural that we merge two sorted arrays first, then find the `kth` element.
This will take O(m + n) time.
Since we need only the kth element, sortedly merge all elements could be avoided.
Use two indexers p1 and p2 pointing to the first element of array A and array B respectively.
Use a counter `m` to record how far the pointers have gone so far.
Move the indexer when the value it points to is less.
When counter `m` equals `k`, we find the solution.
This takes O(k) time, and O(1) space in best case. when k is close to m + n, it will take O(m+n) for worst case.
Overall, it's a O(m + n) algorithm.

**2. O(log(m+n))**  

The flaw of the above algorithm is that we rule out only one element at a time, causing time complexity up to O(m + n).  
If we take advantage of **`binary search idea`** for sorted sequence, by which means rule out half number of the array at a time,  
we should be able to reduce the time complexity to log(m+n). 

Suppose the element number of array A and array B are both greater than k/2.
We compare the k/2-th elment of A and B.   
There should be 3 situations would appear:  

 * A[k/2-1] < B[k/2-1]
 * A[k/2-1] > B[k/2-1]
 * A[k/2-1] == B[k/2-1] 

(1) *A[k/2-1] < B[k/2-1]*
If we merge two arrays, A[0 ... k/2-1] will be in the former k elements. We rule them out, A becomes A[k/2-1 ... n-1].
Recursively find the target element in the A[k/2-1 ... n-1] and B.

(2) *A[k/2-1] > B[k/2-1]* 
If we merge two arrays, B[0 ... k/2-1] will be in the former k elements. We rule them out, B becomes B[k/2-1 ... n-1].
Recursively find the target element in the A and B[k/2-1 ... n-1].

(3) *A[k/2-1] == B[k/2-1]*  
Obviously, we found the kth element, return either A[k/2-1] or B[k/2-1].

**`Recursion stop condition`**

 * if A or B is empty array, return A[k-1] or B[k-1] directly.
 * if A[k/2-1] == B[k/2-1], return either A[k/2-1] or B[k/2-1]
 * if the recursion reduce k to 1 (k == 1), return min(A[0], B[0])

In all other cases, we call our algorithm recursively.

**Note**  
When total number of elements is odd (e.g. k = 2n + 1), the median is nums[(2n + 1)/2 + 1], this is `nums[k/2 + 1]`.  
When total number of elements is even (e.g. k = 2n ), the median is (nums[2n/2 ] + nums[2n/2 + 1])/2, this is `(nums[k/2] + nums[k/2+1])/2`.

In recursion procedure, we alway put shorter array as array A, and longer array as array B.

Also, Be care when the length of the shorter array is smaller than k/2.  
e.g.  
if we take `ia = min(k/2, m)` number of elements of array A, then we should take `ib = k - ia` number of elements of array B.
