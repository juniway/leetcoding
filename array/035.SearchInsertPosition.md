#[LeetCode 35] Search Insert Position

>Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. 
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You may assume no duplicates in the array.

**Examples**

    [1, 3, 5, 6], 5 → 2
    [1, 3, 5, 6], 2 → 1
    [1, 3, 5, 6], 7 → 4
    [1, 3, 5, 6], 0 → 0

**Difficulty**  
`Medium`


####Analysis
This is a variation of `Binary search`.

**Two situations**

1. Binary search the target value in the array, if we find it when low <= high, return mid.  
2. If we failed in the above, this means low > high, we return low.  

**Explanation**

When we failed, that means we need to find the first element whose value is greater than the target value, its index is position where we will insert the new value.
e.g. for [1, 3, 5, 6], we search for 2, we know that 3 is the first element with value greater than 2. Its index is the position we will insert 2. 

// 1. Cpp solution `6ms`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& A, int target) {
    	int n = A.size();
        int low = 0, high = n-1;
        while(low <= high){
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            if(target == A[mid]) 
                return mid;
            else if(target < A[mid])
                high = mid-1;
            else
                low = mid+1;
        }
        return low;
    }
};

// 2. Go solution `9ms`

```go
func searchInsert(nums []int, target int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    low, high := 0, n-1
    for low <= high {
        mid := low + (high-low)/2
        if nums[mid] == target {
            return mid
        } else if nums[mid] > target {
            high = mid - 1
        } else {
            low = mid + 1
        }
    }
    return low
}
