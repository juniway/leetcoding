#[LeetCode 128] Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,

Given `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`,

The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Return its length: `4`.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
