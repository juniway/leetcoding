Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:
This is the fastest method. Traverse linked list using two pointers.  
Move one pointer by one and other pointer by two.  
If these pointers meet at some node then there is a loop.  
If pointers do not meet then linked list doesn’t have loop.

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if(head == NULL) return false;
        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head->next;
 
        while (fast && fast->next){
            if (slow == fast)
                return true;
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        return false;
    }
};

void detectAndRemoveLoop(Node *head){
    Node *slow = head;
    Node *fast = head->next;
 
    // Search for loop using slow and fast pointers
    while (fast && fast->next){
        if (slow == fast)
            break;
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }
 
    /* If loop exists */
    if (slow == fast){
        slow = head;
        while (slow != fast->next){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
 
        /* since fast->next is the looping point */
        fast->next = NULL; /* remove loop */
    }
