#[LeetCode 230] Kth Smallest Element in a BST
Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:**  
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

**Follow up:**
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

**Hint:**  
Try to utilize the property of a BST.
