#[LeetCode 274] H-Index

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia][h-index]:  
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have **at least** h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have **no more than** h citations each."

For example, given `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, which means the researcher has `5` papers in total and each of them 
had received `3, 0, 6, 1, 5` citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with **at least** 3 citations each and the remaining two with **no more than** `3` citations each, his h-index is `3`.

**Note:** If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:  
An easy approach is to sort the array first.
